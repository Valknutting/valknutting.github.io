	<p class="container"><p>I am currently a college student who likes to program and work on computers, so I wanted a website to shitpost about the projects I am currently working on. I wanted a simple blog and after using some services out there and seeing how shit they are, I decided to build one myself. Now, this website is shit, but it does exactly what I need it to do.</p>
<p>In the blog page you will find an ordered list of all my blog posts, and as I type this I just now realized that depending on how many posts I make, the page will just be one long list. May have to fix that later on because I am definitely not doing it now. I have had enough of messing around with html and css just to get something to move over a few pixels lol.</p><p>
