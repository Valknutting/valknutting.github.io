		<h1>How This Website Was Made</h1>

		<p class="container"><p>I made this website out of necessity. I wanted a place to share my projects without needing to pay money to use a companies services, or to give them control of all my data on the website. One of the reasons it was necessary to build my website from scratch was I wanted to have control of all my data, and I am also a poor college student so I needed to do it cheap. Wordpress didn't cut it because It was too complicated for what I wanted to do, and all the other options were expensive and tied me down to one service. </p>
<p>I have been coding in python for some time now and knew that there were some frameworks you could use to make a website with python. Flask ended up being my poison of choice since it looked like I was able to start up a website with it fairly easily, or at least I thought it was going to be easy. What I didn't know was that you still had to use html and css to present the webpages. So I started hacking away at learning a bit of html and css.</p>
<p>I ended up getting a very basic page up, and the only thing that was using flask was the local development server. All the webpages were still built using html and css. I knew that I didn't want to work in html every time I wanted to post a new project. Flask flatpages and flask freeze ended up saving my sanity. These modules were the perfect thing to suit my needs. My ideal workflow would be to make the post in a markdown file and then upload the file to my server which would then be made presentable for a webbrowser. With flatpages, I am able to write my posts in a markdown editor. Flatpages will then translate what is in the markdown files into html content that can be presented through the browser. With flask freeze I am able to translate the development side of my files into all html, css, and the static files. This allows me to upload the files to any server and this makes setting up the server easy since I do not need to make anything special to host flask on the server, it is an html and css only website. </p>
<p>For now this website will be good enough there are a few things I'm going to need to work on down the line. But I have had enough of this project and I am itching to start working on something more exciting.</p><p>
